# Wanted 2022 Hackathon 24-hours Challenge 

This is a 1-day data analytical [challenge](https://www.wanted.jobs/events/coderswantedxtribe?utm_source=email&utm_medium=braze_global&utm_campaign=global_coderswantedxtribe) organised by [Wanted](https://www.wanted.jobs/) in collaboration with [Tribe](https://tribex.co/) from 12 to 13 August 2022.

Participants were given a dataset to analyse, they can choose one out of the four tracks below to base their analysis on. Participants need to submit their report in powerpoint format with everything to be completed within 24hours. 

There are 4 category for applicants to go for:
- Category 1: People. This track is dedicated towards analyses that are people-focused
- Category 2: Skills. This track is for those who are more curious about skills and whether there are any patterns that exist in them. 
- Category 3: Platform. This track is for those who like to dive deep, and uncover patterns for the Wanted team.
- Category 4: This track is for those who prefer to do their own thing, and pursue something that is a little bit of the all categories, or none at all.

The judging criteria are:
- Completeness (30%): Coming up with a useful problem statement, and using the data to tackle the problem statement
- Coherence (30%): Is the analysis coherent and aligned with the problem statement declared?
- Aesthetics (20%): Does the storytelling look good, and does the deck have aesthetic appeal?
- Technical execution (20%): Did the analysis involve doing a deep dive, or just surface-level analyses?
